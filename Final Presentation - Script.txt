with the 1st prototype done, went back to our users to test it out

did a walkthrough via mural board/proto.io with our respective users, and talk down their feedbacks

we compile all the feedback received, group them accordingly to their category

in summary received a mixture of priase, together with questions and critics
for the praises, they generally like the direction we are heading into of using AI tech to simplify the shopping process
for the critics, it is mainly on the design flow and content
	on dessign flow they are poor/confusing work flow from one screen to another, missing button to perform certain steps
	on content we have some wrong information on the sizing, wrong choice of words like bra instread chest, and lack of clear instructions to perform some of the functions
	
As a team, we went throught each and single one
those in red are the ones we ack, and we make the necessary changes in our 2nd prototype
the others (besides the green), becasue of time or low importance, we have decided to put them aside for future referrence

learning points: it takes a diff pair of eye from a diff angle to see the problems, beacause us as the creater will tend to have a bias on the stuff we created

now i will hand over to jasima to present to u the our 2nd & improved prototype


=============================================================================================

To complete any shopping process, user need buy and make payment. So we included the important step as the final task. 

Unlike the previous 3 task where we have added our own inputs/ideas, this is your typical checkout process that u can find on all sites.
Hence I will not go through the details, and will only touch on the changes made after the user feedback.

With this, We have completed our presentation for team 3. Any questions from Lyn, Grace or Surfan
